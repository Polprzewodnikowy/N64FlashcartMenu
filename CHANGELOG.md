### Breaking changes
* GB /GBC emulator changed save type to SRAM (from FRAM) to improve compatibility with Summercart64 (which only uses H/W compatible FRAM), this may break your ability to load existing saves.
* For similar PAL60 functionality, you may need to also enable the new "pal60_compatibility_mode" setting in `config.ini`.


### Current known Issues
* The RTC UI requires improvement (awaiting UI developer).
* Menu sound FX may not work properly when a 64 Disk Drive is also attached (work around: turn sound FX off).
* Fast Rebooting a 64DD disk once will result in a blank screen. Twice will return to menu. This is expected until disk swapping is implemented.
* MP3 Player crashes menu if the MP3 file's sample rate is less than 44100 hz.


### Deprecation notices
* Autoload ROM's will be deprecated in favor of Fast Reboot in a future menu version.
* Old boxart images using filenames for game ID is deprecated and the compatibility mode will be removed in a future release.
