## Initial Setup of an SD Card

### First steps
Insert the (Micro) SD card to your PC and ensure it is properly formatted to be compatible with your flashcart.

#### Preparations for SC64

> [!CAUTION]
> Install the battery correctly, most issues encountered are due to the positive battery terminals being bent due to forced insertion.
> A quick video tutorial on correct insertion can be found here:
> [![Video tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LV5Aj_P3U_E/default.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LV5Aj_P3U_E)

> [!TIP]
> Most (Micro) SD cards are factory formatted to FAT32 or EXFAT and don't require re-formatting.

- Download the latest `sc64menu.n64` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/) page, then place it in the root directory of your Micro SD card.
- Place your ROM files on the Micro SD card, **in any folder except the root directory `menu` folder**.
- Remove the Micro SD Card from your computer and insert it into the SC64. 

### Advanced Steps
Advanced steps are optional, which adds additional capabilities.

#### Add Boxart support
See the [Boxart](./19_gamepak_boxart.md) page.

#### Add Emulator support
See the [Emulators](./18_emulators.md) page.

#### Add 64DD Disk support
See the [64DD](./17_64dd.md) page.

### So what could the layout of the SD card look like?

            └── (some 64DD disk images)
```


## Save Files
All save files (whether `FlashRam`, `SRAM` or `EEPROM`) will be read from a `/saves` folder located **in the same directory as the ROM** 
and they must share the same file name, but use the `.sav` extension. `.sav` files will be created and modified whenever a ROM file saves to 
the "cartridge save memory".

```plaintext
├── (some folder with ROMs)\
    ├── a_rom.z64
    ├── b_rom_whatever.n64
    └── saves\
        ├── a_rom.sav
        └── b_rom_whatever.sav
```

### Transferring saves from an ED64 or emulator
If you are transferring a file from a different flashcart, such as the ED64, or an emulator you must change the file extension to `sav`. 
For example, a save file called `Glover (USA).eep` should have its extension changed to `Glover (USA).sav` to work with N64FlashcartMenu.

> [!CAUTION]
> Saves created with certain emulator versions, or created for a different ROM version (as in revisions of the same game), or region (as in between NTSC and PAL versions of a same game) may be incompatible.

Dependent on the original save, you may need to correct the byte order and/or pad/trim the files to their expected size:

> [!TIP]
> use a tool such as [Ninjiteu's N64SaveConverter](https://github.com/Ninjiteu/N64SaveConverter).
> Certain files may need parsing multiple times.

### Recommended Action
- Make sure you regularly back up important files from the SD Card to your computer to avoid accidental loss.
