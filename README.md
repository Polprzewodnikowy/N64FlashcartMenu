[![N64FlashcartMenu Showcase](http://img.youtube.com/vi/6CKImHTifDA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CKImHTifDA "N64FlashcartMenu Showcase (Oct 12 2023)")


## Aims
* Support as many N64 FlashCarts as possible.
* Be open source, using permissively licensed third-party libraries.
* Be testable, using unit and smoke tests in ares emulated environment.
* Encourage active development from community members and N64 FlashCart owners.
* Support as many common mods and features as possible.


## Experimental features
These features are subject to change:

### N64 ROM autoload
To use the autoload function, while on the `N64 ROM information` display, press the `R` button on your joypad and select the `Set ROM to autoload` option. When you restart the console, it will now only load the selected ROM rather than the menu.
The autoload setting is stored in `config.ini` and persists until changed. This feature may slightly increase boot time as the menu needs to check for the Start button state.
NOTE: To return to the menu, hold the joypad `Start` button while powering on the console.

### GamePak sprites
To use N64 GamePak sprites, place PNG files within the `sd:/menu/boxart/` folder.

#### Supported sprites
These must be `PNG` files that use the following dimensions:
* Standard N64 GamePak boxart sprites: 158x112
* Japanese N64 GamePak boxart sprites: 112x158
* 64DD boxart sprites: 129x112

Supported PNG formats:
* RGB/RGBA color formats
* 8-bit color depth

They will be loaded by directories using each character (case-sensitive) of the full 4 character Game Code (as identified in the menu ROM information).
i.e. for GoldenEye NTSC USA (NGEE), this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/N/G/E/E/boxart_front.png`.
i.e. for GoldenEye PAL (NGEP), this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/N/G/E/P/boxart_front.png`.

To improve compatibility between regions (as a fallback), you may exclude the region ID (last matched directory) for GamePaks to match with 3 letter IDs instead:
i.e. for GoldenEye, this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/N/G/E/boxart_front.png`.

**Warning**: Excluding the region ID may show the wrong boxart.
**Note**: For future support, boxart sprites should also include:
* `boxart_back.png`
* `boxart_top.png`
* `boxart_bottom.png`
* `boxart_left.png`
* `boxart_right.png`

As a starting point, here is a link to a boxart pack following the new structure, including `boxart_front.png` and fallback images:
* [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IpCmFqmGgGwKKmlRBxYObfFR9XywaC6n/view?usp=drive_link)


#### Compatibility mode
If you cannot yet satisfy the correct boxart layout, The menu still has **deprecated** support for filenames containing the Game ID.

**Note:** This will add a noticeable delay for displaying parts of the menu.

Each file must be named according to the 2,3 or 4 letter GamePak ID (matched in this order).
i.e.
* for GoldenEye 4 letters, this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/NGEE.png` and/or `sd:/menu/boxart/NGEP.png`.
* for GoldenEye 3 letters, this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/NGE.png`.
* for GoldenEye 2 letters, this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/GE.png`.

### Menu Settings
The Menu creates a `config.ini` file in `sd:/menu/` which contains various settings that are used by the menu.
If required, you can manually adjust the file on the SD card using your computer.


## Flashcart specific

### SC64
* Ensure the cart has the latest [firmware](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/releases/latest) installed.
* Download the latest `sc64menu.n64` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/) page, then put it in the root directory of your SD card.


### 64drive
* Ensure the cart has the latest [firmware](https://64drive.retroactive.be/support.php) installed.
* Download the latest `menu.bin` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/) page, then put it in the root directory of your SD card.


### ED64 - WIP - UNTESTED AND UNSUPPORTED - USE AT OWN RISK
Currently not supported, but work is in progress (See [PRs](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/pulls)).
**Warning**: The menu may be able to load ROMs but cannot guarantee save functionality. Existing saves may be corrupted.

#### ED64 (Vseries)
The aim is to reach feature parity with [ED64-UnofficialOS](https://github.com/n64-tools/ED64-UnofficialOS-binaries) / [ED64-OfficialOS](https://krikzz.com/pub/support/everdrive-64/v2x-v3x/os-bin/).
Download the `OS64.v64` ROM from the latest [action run - assets] and place it in the `/ED64` folder.

#### ED64 (X series)
X Series support is currently awaiting fixes. Please use the official [OS](https://krikzz.com/pub/support/everdrive-64/x-series/OS/) for now.

#### ED64 (P clone)
Download the `OS64P.v64` ROM from the latest [action run - assets] and place it in the `/ED64P` folder.
The aim is to reach feature parity with [Altra64](https://github.com/networkfusion/altra64)
