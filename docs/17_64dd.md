## 64DD Disk support

Specific flashcarts (such as the [SummerCart64](https://summercart64.dev)) can fully emulate the original 64DD (load, run, save) disks without having a physical device connected to the N64 and don't require conversion ROMs.

To load and run 64DD disk images, place the required 64DD IPL dumps in the `/menu/64ddipl` folder on the SD card.
For more details, follow [this guide on the 64dd.org website](https://64dd.org/tutorial_sc64.html).

> [!TIP]
> Expansion disks expect the same region as the ROM image (Japan -> Japan | US -> US).

> [!WARNING]
> It is not yet possible to swap 64DD disks via N64FlashcartMenu, though this feature will be added in future.

### Conversion ROMs
The N64Flashcart Menu is able to load and run conversion ROMs (but does not perform saves).

### Swap disks
The menu does not "yet" support disk swapping (WiP), however it is supported in the firmware (and can be use by the SummerCart64 terminal app). 

For correct swapping, ensure that you switch them in a compatible context:
Disk Swap Compatibility:
- From DMPJ: DMPJ, DMTJ, DMGJ, DMBJ, EFZJ
- From DMTJ: DMPJ, DMTJ, DMGJ, DMBJ, EFZJ
- From DMGJ: DMPJ, DMTJ, DMGJ, DMBJ, EFZJ
- From DMBJ: DMPJ, DMTJ, DMGJ, DMBJ, EFZJ
- From DKKJ: itself, and DKDJ (required)
- From DSCJ: DMPJ

It is preferable that disks are switched back to the primary disk between each swap, for example: 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4...

### Expansion disks
N64 and 64DD Compatible Combo Matches:
- Mario Party 1:           CLBx -> ELBx
- F-Zero X:                CFZx -> EFZx
- Zelda OoT:               CZLx -> EZLx
- Pokémon Stadium 1 (JPN): CPSJ -> xPSJ (E to Z)
- Pokémon Stadium 2 (JPN): CP2J -> xP2J (E to Z)
- Dezaemon 3D:             CDZx -> EDZx & DEZA (Prototype)
  
(Could just be handled with Cxxx corresponding to Exxx aside from Dezaemon 3D that I think the exception is worth doing)
