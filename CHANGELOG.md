### Current known Issues
* BETA_SETTING: PAL60 when using HDMI mods has regressed (awaiting libdragon fix).
* The RTC UI requires improvement (awaiting UI developer).
* Menu sound FX may not work properly when a 64 Disk Drive is also attached (work around: turn sound FX off).
* ALPHA_FEATURE: ED64 X Series detection does not occur properly (however this is not a problem as not tag released asset).
* ALPHA_FEATURE: ED64 V Series only supports loading ROMs (however this is not a problem as not tag released asset).
