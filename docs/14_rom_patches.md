## ROM Patches (Hacks, Fan Translations, etc.)

At the time of writing, N64FlashcartMenu does not support patching on-the-fly, although you can use various offline and online utilities to patch your games.

Check the [Pull Requests section](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/pulls) for work towards it.

The aim is to support APS/IPS/BPS/XDELTA patches.
