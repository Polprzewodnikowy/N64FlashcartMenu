### Customizing the font
Add a `font64` file to the root directory called `custom.font64`.

<!-- Would be best if we can just link to an actual copy of Mkfont executable file and not expect people to compile libdragon -->
You can build a font64 file with `Mkfont`, one of `libdragon`'s tools. At the time of writing, you will need to obtain `libdragon`'s [preview branch artifacts](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon/actions/workflows/build-tool-windows.yml) to find out a copy of the prebuilt Windows executable. [Read its related Wiki page](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon/wiki/Mkfont) for usage information.
