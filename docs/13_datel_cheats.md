## Datel Cheats
AKA InterAct (in certain regions)

The N64 supports the peripherals
- GameShark
- Action Replay

It is not advised to connect the physical peripheral with most flashcarts.

The menu has underlying support for these codes (when using an expansion pak), but is not yet exposed via the menu graphical user interface.

Check [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/pulls) for work towards it.
