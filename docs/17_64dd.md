## 64DD Disk support

Specific flashcarts (such as the SummerCart64) can fully emulate the original 64DD without having it connected.

**Note**: It is not yet possible to swap 64DD disks via N64FlashcartMenu.

To load and run 64DD disk images, place the required 64DD IPL dumps in the `/menu/64ddipl` folder on the SD card.
For more details, follow [this guide on the 64dd.org website](https://64dd.org/tutorial_sc64.html).
