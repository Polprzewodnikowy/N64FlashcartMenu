All expected files (including any in sub directories) contained within this folder will be copied and consumed as if they are within this root `filesystem` folder.

The current expected files used by `makefile` have the extensions:
* wav64
* font64
* sprite

Adding files in the following directories are used as a fallback for the same files as would be added on an SD card:
* `menu/emulators`
* `menu/ddipl`
