[![N64FlashcartMenu Showcase](http://img.youtube.com/vi/6CKImHTifDA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CKImHTifDA "N64FlashcartMenu Showcase (Oct 12 2023)")


## Aims
* Support as many N64 FlashCarts as possible.
* Be open source, using permissive licensed third party licensed libraries.
* Be testable, using unit and smoke tests in ares emulated environment.
* Encourage active development from community members and N64 FlashCart owners.
* Support as many common mods and features as possible.


## Experimental features
These features are subject to change:

### N64 ROM autoload
To use the autoload function, while on the `N64 ROM information` display, press the `R` button on your joypad and select the `Set ROM to autoload` option. When you restart the console, it will now only load the selected ROM rather than the menu.
NOTE: to return to the menu, hold joypad `start` button whilst powering on the console. 

### GamePak sprites
To use N64 `GamePak` sprites, place `PNG` files within the `sd:/menu/boxart/` folder.


#### Supported sprites
These must be `PNG` files that use the following dimensions:
* Standard N64 GamePak boxart sprites: 158x112
* Japanese N64 GamePak boxart sprites: 112x158
* 64DD boxart sprites: 129x112

They will be loaded by directories using each character (case-sensitive) of the full 4 character Game Code (as identified in the menu ROM information).
i.e. for GoldenEye NTSC USA (NGEE), this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/N/G/E/E/boxart_front.png`.
i.e. for GoldenEye PAL (NGEP), this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/N/G/E/P/boxart_front.png`.

To improve compatibility between regions (as a fallback), you may exclude the region ID (last matched directory) for GamePaks to match with 3 letter IDs instead:
i.e. for GoldenEye, this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/N/G/E/boxart_front.png`.

**Note1:** Excluding the region ID may show the wrong boxart.
**Note2:** For future support, boxart sprites should also include: `boxart_back.png`, `boxart_top.png`, `boxart_bottom.png`, `boxart_left.png`, `boxart_right.png`.

As a starting point, here is a link to a boxart pack following the new structure, including `boxart_front.png` and failback images:

#### Compatibilty mode
If you cannot yet satisfy the correct boxart layout, The menu still has **deprecated** support for filenames containing the Game ID.

**Note:** This will add a noticeable delay for displaying parts of the menu.

Each file must be named according to the 2,3 or 4 letter GamePak ID (matched in this order).
i.e.
* for GoldenEye 4 letters, this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/NGEE.png` and/or `sd:/menu/boxart/NGEP.png`.
* for GoldenEye 3 letters, this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/NGE.png`.
* for GoldenEye 2 letters, this would be `sd:/menu/boxart/GE.png`.

* [European Boxart](https://mega.nz/file/OmIV3aAK#kOWdutK1_41ffN64R6thbU7HEPR_M9qO0YM2mNG6RbQ)
* [64DD Boxart](https://mega.nz/file/ay5wQIxJ#k3PF-VMLrZJxJTr-BOaOKa2TBIK7c2t4zwbdshsQl40)


### Menu Settings
The Menu creates a `config.ini` file in `sd:/menu/` which contains various settings that are used by the menu.
If required, you can manually adjust the file on the SD card using your computer.


## Flashcart specific

### SC64
* Ensure the cart has the latest [firmware](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/releases/latest) installed.
* Download the latest `sc64menu.n64` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/) page, then put it in the root directory of your SD card.


### 64drive
* Ensure the cart has the latest [firmware](https://64drive.retroactive.be/support.php) installed.
* Download the latest `menu.bin` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/) page, then put it in the root directory of your SD card.


### ED64 & ED64P
Currently not supported, but work is in progress (See [PR's](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/pulls)).

The aim is to replace [Altra64](https://github.com/networkfusion/altra64) and [ED64-UnofficialOS](https://github.com/n64-tools/ED64-UnofficialOS-binaries).
