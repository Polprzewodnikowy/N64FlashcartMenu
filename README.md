## Aims

* Be open source, using permissive licensed third party licensed libraries.
* Be testable, using unit and smoke tests in ares emulated environment.
* Encourage active development from community members and N64 FlashCart owners.
* Support as many common mods and features as possible.


## Experimental features
These features are subject to change:

### ROM Boxart
To use boxart, you need to place png files of size 158x112 in the folder `/menu/boxart` on the SD card.
Each file must be named according to the 2 letter ROM ID, or 3 letter ROM ID including media type.
i.e. for GoldenEye 2 letters, this would be `GE.png`.
i.e. for GoldenEye 3 letters, this would be `NGE.png`.
A known set of PNG files using 2 letter ID's can be downloaded [here](https://mega.nz/file/6cNGwSqI#8X5ukb65n3YMlGaUtSOGXkKo9HxVnnMOgqn94Epcr7w).


### Menu Settings
The Menu creates a `config.ini` file in `sd:/menu/` which contains various settings that are used by the menu.
If required, you can manually adjust the file on the SD card using your computer.


## Flashcart specific

### SC64
* Ensure the cart has the latest [firmware](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/SummerCart64/releases/latest) installed.
* Download the latest `sc64menu.n64` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/) page, then put it in the root directory of your SD card.


### 64drive
* Ensure the cart has the latest [firmware](https://64drive.retroactive.be/support.php) installed.
* Download the latest `menu.bin` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/releases/) page, then put it in the root directory of your SD card.


### ED64 & ED64P
Currently not supported, but work is in progress (See [PR's](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/pulls)).

The aim is to replace [Altra64](https://github.com/networkfusion/altra64) and [ED64-UnofficialOS](https://github.com/n64-tools/ED64-UnofficialOS-binaries).
