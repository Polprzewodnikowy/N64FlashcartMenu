## Emulators
N64FlashcartMenu supports multiple emulators that are compatible with the N64. At the time of writing, current emulator support includes NES, SNES, GB, GBC, SMS, GG, and CHF ROMs.

Emulators should be added to the `/menu/emulators` directory on the SD card. N64FlashcartMenu currently supports the following emulators and associated ROM file names:
- **NES**: [neon64v2](https://github.com/hcs64/neon64v2/releases) by *hcs64* - `neon64bu.rom`
- **SNES**: [sodium64](https://github.com/Hydr8gon/sodium64/releases) by *Hydr8gon* - `sodium64.z64`
- **Game Boy**/**GB Color**: [gb64](https://lambertjamesd.github.io/gb64/romwrapper/romwrapper.html) by *lambertjamesd* - `gb.v64`/`gbc.v64` ("Download Emulator" button)
- **SMS**/**GG**: [smsPlus64](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/smsplus64/releases) by *fhoedmakers* - `smsPlus64.z64`
