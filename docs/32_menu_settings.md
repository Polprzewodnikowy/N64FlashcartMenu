## Menu Settings
The Menu creates a `config.ini` file in `sd:/menu/` which contains various settings that are used and can be set within the menu.
If required, you can manually adjust the file on the SD card using your computer.


### Show Hidden Files
The default is off.

### Use Save Folders
The default is on.
ON: ROM saves are saved in a seperate subfolder (called saves).
OFF: ROM saves are saved alongside the ROM file.

### Sound effects
The menu has default sound effects to improve the experience that can be turned on in the settings menu (the default is off).
