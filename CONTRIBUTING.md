# Contributing to N64FlashcartMenu

This document is for people wanting to contribute to the implementation of N64FlashcartMenu.
This involves interacting with implementation changes that are proposed using [GitHub](https://github.com/) [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests) to the [N64FlashcartMenu](https://github.com/Polprzewodnikowy/N64FlashcartMenu/) repository (which you're in right now).

As such, a GitHub account is recommended, which you can sign up for [here](https://github.com/signup).

Additionally this document assumes that you already know how to use GitHub and Git.
If that's not the case, we recommend learning about it first [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).
