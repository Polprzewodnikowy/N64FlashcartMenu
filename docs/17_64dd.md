## 64DD Disk support

Specific flashcarts (such as the [SummerCart64](https://summercart64.dev)) can fully emulate the original 64DD (load, run, save) disks without having a physical device connected to the N64 and don't require conversion ROMs.

To load and run 64DD disk images, place the required 64DD IPL dumps in the `/menu/64ddipl` folder on the SD card.
For more details, follow [this guide on the 64dd.org website](https://64dd.org/tutorial_sc64.html).

**Note**: It is not yet possible to swap 64DD disks via N64FlashcartMenu.

### Conversion ROMs
The N64Flashcart Menu is able to load and run conversion ROMs (but does not perform saves).
