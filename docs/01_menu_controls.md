## Menu Controls

### Additional Control Information

#### Fast scroll
Press either the C-Up or C-Down buttons to scroll by pages, rather than by elements.

#### N64FlashcartMenu settings
Press the START button at the browser screen to open the Settings window. From here you can edit some of the N64FlashcartMenu settings, 
see information of either the console, the flashcart you are using or N64FlashcartMenu itself, and if your cart has Real-Time Clock (RTC) support, 
you will also be able to change its date and time.

#### Browser options
Press the R button to open the Browser Options window. Here you can see a ROM's properties, delete it from your SD card or establish the default folder 
where N64FlashcartMenu's browser will start in future boots.

#### Additional ROM information
Press either the L or Z button at the ROM information screen to open an additional window that will show additional information of the currently 
selected ROM file, such as its endianess, the regional variant, its set clock rate, and much more.

### 64DD ROM

#### Expansion disks
To load an expansion disk (such as F-Zero X), first browse to the N64 ROM and load it (**but not start it!**), then browse to the 64DD expansion file and press the `R` button.

#### Disk swapping
This feature is not currently available in N64FlashcartMenu.
