### Breaking changes
* Deprecated "Autoload ROM" function was removed from menu (use `FEATURE_AUTOLOAD_ROM_ENABLED` as a build flag to re-enable it).
* Deprecated Boxart image handler was removed (see [documentation](./docs/19_gamepak_boxart.md) for new boxart link).


### Current known Issues
* The RTC UI requires improvement (awaiting UI developer).
* Menu sound FX may not work properly when a 64 Disk Drive is also attached (work around: turn sound FX off).
* Fast Rebooting a 64DD disk once will result in a blank screen. Twice will return to menu. This is expected until disk swapping is implemented.
* MP3 Player crashes menu if the MP3 file's sample rate is less than 44100 hz and menu SFX are enabled.


### Deprecation notices
* TBD
