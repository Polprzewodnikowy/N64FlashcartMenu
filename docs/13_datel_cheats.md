## Cheats (Gameshark, etc.)

The N64FlashcartMenu has underlying support for the cheat code types made popular by the peripherals:
- GameShark
- Action Replay

Another product by Blaze, called the Xploder64/Xplorer64 also existed in some regions, but these codes are unlikely to work.

> [!WARNING]
> It is not advised to connect a physical cheat cartridge in conjunction with most flashcarts.

> [!CAUTION]
> The N64FlashcartMenu can only support cheat codes based on Datel carts when **also** using an Expansion Pak. Codes will not be loaded when the Expansion Pak is not found.

Caveats:
- Requires an Expansion Pak.
- Codes that require a button to pressed are not yet supported.

Certain codes are not yet supported, because, for instance:
- they rely on the button.

> [!TIP]
> a good reference for generating codes is: https://gamehacking.org


Currently it is necessary (from the ROM info screen) to press `R` and load the `Datel Code Editor`. Press `A` to `Apply ROM with these cheats` AND then press `R` to set `Use Cheats` to `Enabled` whilst in the ROM info screen, before finally running the ROM by pressing `A`.
