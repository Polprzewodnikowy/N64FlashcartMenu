## Menu Settings
N64FlashcartMenu automatically creates a `config.ini` file in `sd:/menu/`, which contains various settings that can be set within the menu's Settings editor.
If required, you can manually adjust the file (required for some advanced settings) on the SD card using your computer.

### Show Hidden Files
Shows any N64FlashcartMenu system-related files. This setting is OFF by default.

### Use Save Folders
Controls whether N64FlashcartMenu should use `/saves` folders to store ROM save data. This setting is ON by default.
ON: ROM saves are saved in separate subfolders (called `\saves`, will create one `\saves` subfolder per folder).
OFF: ROM saves are saved alongside the ROM file.

### Sound Effects
The menu has default sound effects to improve the user experience. This setting is OFF by default.
