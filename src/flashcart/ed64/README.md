This folder allows support for the ED64 "Official" flashcart when using V series hardware.
For the moment it is unlikely to support clones.

It is based on OS 2.12.x as used in the "Unofficial Menu".

It requires a lot of cleansing and updating to use the latest libdragon before it will probably work based on the fact that using the latest libdragon with `libcart` seems to have a detremental effect on the ability to load ROM's.
