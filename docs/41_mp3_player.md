## MP3 Player
N64FlashcartMenu includes a MP3 Player that can read any MP3 files from the SD Card.

Select an MP3 file in the File Browser to go to the MP3 Player screen, where the audio playback will begin immediately.

Here you can pause the playback by pressing the `A` Button, and skip the audio forward or backwards by pressing either `Left` or `Right` on the directional buttons or the Control Stick. When you want to stop the playback and return to the File Browser, press the `B` Button.
