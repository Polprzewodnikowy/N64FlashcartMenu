### How to add a background image
First copy an image in .PNG format to anywhere on the SD card. Then when the N64FlashcartMenu is loaded on the N64, browse to the image and then select it to show it on the screen. Press the `A` Button again to open up the confirmation message, which will ask if you want to set a new background image.
<!-- Could use a sample screenshot here -->
Press the `A` Button to confirm and set the image as your new background or press the `B` Button to cancel and return to the image display screen.
