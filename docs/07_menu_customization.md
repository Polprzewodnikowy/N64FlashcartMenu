## Menu Customization

### Customizing the font
Add a `font64` file to the root directory called "custom.font64". You can build a font64 file with the `libdragon` tools.

### Adding a background image
Add an image to the SD card. When browsing the menu, select and load the image and then respond to the dialogue message.
